# Air-Quality-Prediction
Hybrid ML Modeling: Air quality prediction using XGBOOST with GAN
The proposed system architecture consists of four main
components:
A. Data improvement module
Data for remote measurement handles (e.g., satellite/drone
sensor, IoT device):
• The noise suppresses (removes outliers, smoothing of
irregular readings)
• Common functions (e.g., scales, contaminants such as
PM2.5, CO)
• The better model expands data (growth or through syn-
thetic generation) for normalization

B. Multi-Level Extraction (CNN-based)
A fixed neural network (CNN) extracts multi-level features
to capture:
• Local variations (e.g., polluting hotspots)
• Global trends (e.g., regional air quality patterns)
• Detects spatial addiction (e.g., dissemination of pollution
in areas)

C. Reference conscious modeling
Integrates environmental factors (weather, traffic, industrial
activity) to separate:
• Genuine pollution signal versus noise (e.g., cloud, sensor
error)
• The mediation mechanism or graph uses neural networks
(GNN) to model the ratio of the variables

D. Finishing and perfection
• False positive reduction: Filter crazy predictions (e.g.,
sudden spikes due to sensor errors)
• Duplicated handling: Overlapping data (e.g., from
drone/satellites covering the same area) merges
• Effective optimization: accelerates effectively on edge
units (drones, satellites) through quantization/pruning
